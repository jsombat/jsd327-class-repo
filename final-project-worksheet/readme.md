# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|May 1st| Project Description | Complete
|May 8th| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Complete
|May 15th| External API(s) Decision / Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Complete
|May 22nd| Minimal Viable Product | Incomplete
|May 29th| Styling / Bug Fixes | Incomplete


## Project Description
I’d like to build a site that will help with hosting dinner parties, by making it easier to manage invitations. I can send a url that will capture guest information and minimize group email back and forth.

A user will be able to view dates and descriptions for upcoming parties, be able to sign up to attend (capture name, number of guests and email), and choose from a dropdown of things to bring. If someone has already selected something, it shouldn’t show up in the selection for subsequent guests. 

Post MVP- generate a calendar invite


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Display Cards 
- Make a Form
- Collect the user info in a JSON 
- Show a confirmation screen
- Email a confirmation (?) 

#### PostMVP 

- Put JSON in a spreadsheet
- User Login
- Hide cards that have already happened

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous  phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Display Cards | H | 1.5hrs| --hrs | --hrs |
| Make A Form | H | 1.5hrs| --hrs | --hrs |
| Make A Form | H | 1.5hrs| --hrs | --hrs |
| Collect User Info in JSON | M | 1hrs| --hrs | --hrs |
| Show Confirmation | H | 2hrs| --hrs | --hrs |
| Email Confirmation | L | 2hrs| --hrs | --hrs |
| Total | H | 9.5hrs| --hrs | --hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## jQuery Discoveries
 Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
